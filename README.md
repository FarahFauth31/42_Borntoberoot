# 42_Borntoberoot
With this project I got the chance to set up my first server using VirtualBox.<br>
<br>
My chosen OS was the last stable version of Debian (12.4.0).
When setting up my server, I didn't install a graphical interface and I created encrypted partitions using LVM. I set up the SSH service and the UFW firewall. I installed sudo.
I implemented a strong password policy (edit sudo_config defaults, edit common-password).
